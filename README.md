ONE Eternal Patch v1.1
======

About
---------

ONE Eternal Patch is a patch for the visual novel ONE \~Kagayaku Kisetsu e\~.<br/>
The goal of this patch is to create an enhanced experience by implementing the new content introduced in the PS1 version of the novel.<br/>
As of right now this patch adds bonus CGs and allows you to partially remove the H-scenes, future releases will allow players to fully remove H-scenes and also add Natsuki's route.

How to use it?
---------

1. Move the files "ONE_Eternal_Patch_v1.1.exe", "ONE_Patch_Files" and "ONE_Patch_Files.lst" into the same folder as your "one" and "one.lst" (or "lcsebody1" and "lcsebody1.lst") files.<br/>
2. Launch the "ONE_Eternal_Patch.exe" file.<br/>
3. Select the edition and language you're using and the content you want to have.

How to know the edition I am using?
---------

Open the directory of the game, if you've files named "One.exe", "one" and "one.lst" then you've the Full Voice Edition, if you've files named "lcsebody.exe", "lcsebody1" and "lcsebody1.lst" you're using the Vista Edition.

FAQ
---------

Are the bonus CGs worth it?<br/>
YES.

What versions of the game is this patch compatible with?<br/>
This patch is compatible with the Full Voice Edition and the Vista Edition of the game, it works with both the Japanese and English translated versions.<br/>
I plan to add support to the Chinese, Korean and Spanish translated versions but it is not a high priority.

Why the patch removes the H-scenes only partially?<br/>
This patch removes totally the H-scenes from the routes of Akane and Mio, it also removes all the HCGs from the gallery.<br/>
The H-scenes in the 4 other routes are mandatory to get the true ending of each route that's why their removing is harder. The PS1 edition of the game makes a lot of little changes in the story to make their removing coherent with the story and I need to port these changes to remove the H-scenes completely. For the moment, I've replaced all the HCGs by black screens so you'll not see any sexual content but you'll still have to read some.

Where does the CGs come from?<br/>
The 14 standard bonus CGs were extracted from the second CD of the Limited Edition of ONE, so they're in HQ (640x480 instead of the compressed 640x240 CGs of the first CD). However, I needed to take the background CG of Misaki's house from the first CD, I used waifu2x to make it look nicer.

Are my old saves compatible with the patch?<br/>
Your global save (SAVE__.LCS) is fully compatible with the patch and you can still use it to keep the progress of the CGs that you've unlocked.<br/>
For most standard saves, the answer is yes and no. Each of your saves keep track of the code's position of the last text you've seen. I added some code to add the bonus CGs so if you saved in one of the scripts I have modified then you can be in trouble. It can work or it might glitch or do some weird things. If your save doesn't work I recommend to use a walkthrough to get back where you were in the game.

I've seen a bonus CGs but it's not unlocked in the gallery?<br/>
That's normal. All of the CGs have an ID that is saved automatically in the global save when you see one of them, I can create new IDs but none of them are designated to be saved in the global save. So, for all of the bonus CGs in the gallery, I've affected the ID of the next obligatory CG that you see in the route concerned. So you'll unlock all the bonus CGs eventually, you just need to be patient. Hopefully, it'll be fixed in a new version.

What is the progress of the Nayuki's route port?<br/>
I've extracted all the scripts from this route from the PS1 game and I search someone to translate them, please contact me if you're interested.
