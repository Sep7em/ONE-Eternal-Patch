ONE Eternal Patch v1.1
======

About
---------

ONE Eternal Patch is a patch for the visual novel ONE \~Kagayaku Kisetsu e\~.<br/>
The goal of this patch is to create an enhanced experience by implementing the new content introduced in the PS1 version of the novel.<br/>
As of right now this patch adds bonus CGs, allows you to partially remove the H-scenes and fixes some minor glitches. Future releases will allow players to fully remove H-scenes and also add Natsuki's route.

How to use it?
---------

1. Launch the "ONE_Eternal_Patch_v1.2.exe" file.<br/>
2. Select the language and edition you're using and the content you want to have.

How to know the edition I am using?
---------

Open the directory of the game, if you've files named:<br/>
- "One.exe", "one" and "one.lst" then you're using the Full Voice Edition<br/>
- "lcsebody.exe", "lcsebody1" and "lcsebody1.lst" then you're using the Vista Edition<br/>
- "One_cn.exe", "one_cn" and "one_cn.lst" then you're using the Chinese translation (with the Full Voice or Vista Edition but it's not important to know the edition with this translation)

Compatibility
---------

This patch is compatible with the Full Voice Edition and the Vista editions of the game, it works with the Japanese version and the English, Spanish and Chinese translations.

It shouldn't be necessary to know since the translation patches haven't got any update since a very long time but here are the versions I've used for each of them if you want to know:<br/>
English: Version 1.5<br/>
Spanish: Version 1.3<br/>
Chinese: Version 1.0 (Famille Hanhuazu)

I haven't added a compatibility with the Korean patch yet since it's a difficult patch to work with and since it doesn't seem to be finished but it'll be done eventually.<br/>
The Eternal Patch isn't compatible with the old Chinese patch made by the Key Fans Club as I can't find it online and since the newer patch seems better.

Glitches being fixed
---------

The patch fixes a few minor glitches present in the gallery:<br/>
- Mio had a headpat CG that you weren't able to see because the developers forgot a few lines of code<br/>
- Nanase had some CG miniatures that had a 1 pixel white line because of the way they were disposed in the assets<br/>
- In the Spanish translation, Mayu's name was written in Japanese because the devs didn't name one of the files correctly<br/>
Note that these glitches are only fixed if you apply at least one of the changes brought by the Eternal Patch.<br/>

FAQ
---------

Are the bonus CGs worth it?<br/>
YES.

Why the patch removes the H-scenes only partially?<br/>
This patch completely removes the H-scenes from the routes of Akane and Mio and it also removes all the HCGs from the gallery.<br/>
The H-scenes in the 4 other routes are mandatory to get the true ending of each route that's why their removing is harder. The PS1 edition of the game makes a lot of little changes in the story to make their removing coherent with the story and I need to port these changes to remove the H-scenes completely. For the moment, I've replaced all the HCGs by black screens so you'll not see any sexual content but you'll still have to read some.

Where does the CGs come from?<br/>
The 14 standard bonus CGs were extracted from the second CD of the Limited Edition of ONE, so they're in HQ (640x480 instead of the compressed 640x240 CGs of the first CD). However, I needed to take the background CG of Misaki's house from the first CD, I used waifu2x to make it look nicer.

Are my old saves compatible with the patch?<br/>
Your global save (SAVE__.LCS) is fully compatible with the patch and you can still use it to keep the progress of the CGs that you've unlocked.<br/>
For most standard saves, the answer is yes and no. Each of your saves keep track of the code's position of the last text you've seen. I added some code to add the bonus CGs so if you saved in one of the scripts I have modified then you can be in trouble. It can work or it might glitch or do some weird things. If your save doesn't work I recommend to use a walkthrough to get back where you were in the game.

I've seen a bonus CGs but it's not unlocked in the gallery?<br/>
That's normal. All of the CGs have an ID that is saved automatically in the global save when you see one of them, I can create new IDs but none of them are designated to be saved in the global save. So, for all of the bonus CGs in the gallery, I've affected the ID of the next obligatory CG that you see in the route concerned. So you'll unlock all the bonus CGs eventually, you just need to be patient. Hopefully, it'll be fixed in a new version.

What is the progress of the Natsuki's route port?<br/>
The translation of the route in English has started. I search people to translate it into Spanish, Chinese and Korean.
