======

About
---------

ONE Eternal Patch is a patch for the visual novel ONE \~Kagayaku Kisetsu e\~.<br/>
The goal of this patch is to make a better version of the game with the content of the PS1 version.<br/>

2. Launch the "ONE Eternal Patch.exe" file.<br/>
3. Choose the Japanese or English version and choose if you want to install the patch or to remove it.

FAQ
---------

Are the bonus CGs worth it?<br/>
YES.

With what versions of the game this patch is compatible?<br/>
This patch is compatible with the Full Voice Edition of the game, it works both with the Japanese and English translated version.
I've no idea if the patch is compatible with the Vista Edition since I can't buy it on Getchu.
It is planned to add support of the Chinese and Spanish translated versions but it's not the priority.

Where does the CGs come from?<br/>
The 14 standard bonus CGs were extracted from the second CD of the Limited Edition of ONE, so they're in HQ (640x480 instead of the compressed 640x240 CGs of the first CD). However, I needed to take the background CG of the house of Misaki from the first CD, I've used waifu2x to make her looks nicer.

Are my old saves compatible with the patch?<br/>
Your global save (SAVE__.LCS) is fully compatible with the patch and you can still use it to keep the progress of the CGs that you've unlocked.<br/>
For the most standard saves, the reponse is yes and no. Each of your saves keep tracks of the position of the instruction of the last text you've seen. I've added some instructions to add the bonus CGs so if you've saved in one of the scripts I've modified you can be in trouble. It can works or it can glitches or do some weird things. If your save doesn't work I just recommend to use a walkthrough to get back where you were in the game.

I've seen a bonus CGs but it's not unlocked in the gallery?<br/>
It's normal. All of the CGs have an ID that is saved automatically in the global save when you see one of them. I can create new IDs but none of them are designated to be saved in the global save. So, for all of the bonus CGs in the gallery, I've affected the ID of the next obligatory CG that you see in the route concerned. So you'll unlocked all the bonus CGs eventually, you just need to be patient. Hopefully, it'll be fixed in a new version.
