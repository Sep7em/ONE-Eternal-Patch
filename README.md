FAQ
---------

Are the bonus CGs worth it?<br/>
YES.

What versions of the game is this patch compatible with?<br/>
This patch is compatible with the Full Voice Edition of the game, it works with both the Japanese and English translated version.<br/>
I have no idea if the patch is compatible with the Vista Edition since I can't buy it on Getchu.<br/>
I plan to add support to the Chinese and Spanish translated versions but it is not a high priority.

Where does the CGs come from?<br/>
The 14 standard bonus CGs were extracted from the second CD of the Limited Edition of ONE, so they're in HQ (640x480 instead of the compressed 640x240 CGs of the first CD). However, I needed to take the background CG of Misaki's house from the first CD, I used waifu2x to make it look nicer.

Are my old saves compatible with the patch?<br/>
Your global save (SAVE__.LCS) is fully compatible with the patch and you can still use it to keep the progress of the CGs that you've unlocked.<br/>
For most standard saves, the answer is yes and no. Each of your saves keep track of the code's position of the last text you've seen. I added some code to add the bonus CGs so if you saved in one of the scripts I have modified then you can be in trouble. It can work or it might glitch or do some weird things. If your save doesn't work I recommend to use a walkthrough to get back where you were in the game.

I've seen a bonus CGs but it's not unlocked in the gallery?<br/>
That's normal. All of the CGs have an ID that is saved automatically in the global save when you see one of them, I can create new IDs but none of them are designated to be saved in the global save. So, for all of the bonus CGs in the gallery, I've affected the ID of the next obligatory CG that you see in the route concerned. So you'll unlock all the bonus CGs eventually, you just need to be patient. Hopefully, it'll be fixed in a new version.
